# Breadcrumbs

This app is a way to drop digital "breadcrumbs" so you can find that location again.
The inspiration for this app, and its primary intended use if for finding the
location of rock climbing areas. On [Mountain Project](http://www.mountainproject.com/)
there are directions to many areas, but those directions are often outdated.
To change that I plan on going out and finding those locations and posting their
coordinates online.
